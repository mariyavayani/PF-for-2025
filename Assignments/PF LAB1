Q1. Write pseudo-code and draw flowchart to get temperature in Fahrenheit as input and
convert it to kelvin.
PSEUDOCODE:
BEGIN
VARIABLES K, F
OUTPUT “Enter temperature in Fahrenheit”
INPUT F
K = (F-32) * 5/9 + 273.15
OUTPUT “The temperature in kelvin is”, K
END


Q2. Write pseudo-code and flowchart to calculate the area of a circle with radius taken as input.
PSEUDOCODE:
BEGIN
VARIABLES area, radius
OUTPUT “Enter radius.”
INPUT radius
area = 3.14 * radius * radius
OUTPUT “Area of circle is”, area
END


Q3. Write pseudo-code and draw a flowchart to convert km/hour to miles/hour.
PSEUDOCODE:
BEGIN
VARIABLES km_hr, miles_hr
INPUT km_hr
miles_hr = km_hr * 0.621
OUTPUT miles_hr
END


Q4. Write a pseudo-code and draw a flowchart to take hours and minutes as input and calculate
the total number of seconds.
PSEUDOCODE:
BEGIN
VARIABLES hours, minutes, seconds
OUTPUT “Enter number of hours and minutes.”
INPUT hours, minutes
seconds = (hours * 3600) + (minutes * 60)
OUTPUT “The total number of seconds is”, seconds
END


Q5. PSEUDO-CODE
BEGIN
VARIABLES people, reams, report_pgs, copies, total_pgs
OUTPUT “Enter the number of people and number of pages.”
INPUT people, report_pgs
copies = people + 5
total_pgs = report_pgs * copies
reams = INT(total_pgs / 500) + 1
OUTPUT “The number of reams required for a meeting is”, reams
END

TESTING THE SOLUTION:
report_pgs = 140
people = 25
copies = 25 + 5 = 30
total_pgs = 140*30 = 4200
reams = INT(4200/500) = 8.4 = 8 + 1 = 9
“The number of reams required for a meeting is 9”.


Q6. PSEUDO-CODE
BEGIN
VARIABLES height, width, req_length, length
OUTPUT “Enter height and width.”
INPUT height, width
length = (5 * width) + (height * 2)
req_length = length/12
OUTPUT “The number of feet required is”, req_length
END
