//Q4
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
	int test = 3000000000;

}


/*The wrong value is displayed because 3000000000 exceeds the maximum limit of a 32-bit signed int. 
This causes integer overflow, wrapping the value into the negative range. The solution is to use a larger data type like long long.*/
